Advantage of C++ in programming contests:

* compiled code runs very quickly (even faster than Java, Haskell and V8
  JavaScript)

Disadvantages of C++ in programming contests:

* memory errors (e.g. segfault), no array bounds checking
* no stack trace
* ints are not unbounded by default
* no unbounded ints in the standard library
* no easy int overflow detection
* uninitialized variables (there is a warning)
* no automatic memory management (not a big problem)
* no regexps (not a problem most of the time)
* printf on long double doesn't work on Windows (MinGW) (solved in -lr)
* cin and cout are very slow (solved in -lr)
* printf and scanf are not type-safe (e.g. int vs long long) (solved in -lr)
* I/O and parse errors remain undetected by default (solved in -lr)
* no easy way to dump a data structure (like Ruby p and Python repr) (solved in -lr)
